# Churn-Analysis-Simulation

I recently took a Data Science Job Simulation hosted by Forage. This job simulation focuses on analyzing customer churn for a major gas and electricity utility provider, and investigates how price sensitivity impacts customer retention. As the energy market evolves and more options become available for customers, retaining customers has become a critical issue. 

General Overview of this simulation:

1. Completed a customer churn analysis simulation for XYZ Analytics,
   demonstrating advanced data analytics skills, identifying essential client
   data and outlining a strategic investigation approach.
2. Conducted efficient data analysis using Python, including Pandas and NumPy.
   Employed data visualization techniques for insightful trend interpretation.
3. Completed the engineering and optimization of a random forest model,
   achieving an 85% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn.
4. Completed a concise executive summary for the Associate Director, delivering
   actionable insights for informed decision-making based on the analysis.
